notes:
-in filter.py, instructions said to define the lambda part in a function.
 could have done more testing
-in map.py, this isn't the right formula for fahrenheit-celsius conversion
-in theft.py, good idea to print stuff out, and if you had done more of this
 in the function you defined you might have seen the issue, which is that you
 were iterating over a list of dictionaries but not accessing the values in
 those dictionaries. to fix this you just need to use text[x]['text'] in your
 if statements. please let me know if this doesn't make sense
